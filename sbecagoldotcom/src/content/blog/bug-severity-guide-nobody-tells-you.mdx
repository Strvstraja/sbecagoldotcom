# The Bug Severity Guide Nobody Tells You About

Every QA course teaches you the "official" bug severity levels:

- **Critical:** System is down, nobody can work
- **High:** Major functionality broken
- **Medium:** Some features affected
- **Low:** Minor issues, cosmetic problems

Looks clean on paper, right?

Here's what nobody tells you: that's not how it actually works.

After over a decade in QA, I've learned that bug severity has very little to do with technical impact and sometimes has everything to do with who notices it.

Let me show you the REAL bug severity guide.

## Critical (AKA "Everything Is On Fire")

**Official definition:** Complete system failure, all users affected, business cannot operate.

**What it actually means:** The business literally cannot function right now.

This is the real deal. Money isn't flowing. Users can't log in. Data is corrupted. The entire system is down. Production is broken and customers are screaming.

Critical doesn't mean "bad" or "embarrassing" or "the CEO noticed." Critical means "stop everything and address this NOW because we're actively losing money/users/data… and probably our jobs too..."

If you can still operate, even badly, it's not Critical (Not really).

### How to spot it:

- Complete system outage (nobody can access the app)
- Payment processing is completely broken (money is not flowing)
- Data loss or corruption (customer data being destroyed)
- Security breach is actively happening (unauthorized access right now)
- Core functionality is dead for ALL users (not just some edge case)

### Real examples:

- "Production database crashed, all users getting 500 errors" (Critical: business is down)
- "Payment gateway returning errors for 100% of transactions" (Critical: no money coming in)
- "User authentication broken, nobody can log in" (Critical: system unusable)
- "API endpoint exposing user passwords in plain text" (Critical: active security breach)
- "Data migration script deleted production customer records" (Critical: data loss)

### What's NOT Critical (even though people say it is):

- "The logo is off-center on homepage" (Not Critical: annoying, not business-stopping)
- "CEO saw a typo in the email template" (Not Critical: embarrassing, not broken)
- "One specific workflow broken for 5% of users" (High, not Critical: some users affected, not all)
- "Mobile app crashes on iPhone 6" (High, not Critical: old device, workaround exists: use newer phone or web)

## High (AKA "This Will Cost Us Money")

**Official definition:** Major functionality broken, significant user impact.

**What it actually means:** Someone can connect it to revenue or a contract obligation.

Not all payment bugs are High. The payment bug that affects enterprise customers paying $50K/year? High. The payment bug that only happens when you use a specific combination of discount codes? Medium at best.

If you can put a dollar amount on it, or if Legal is asking questions, it's High.

### How to spot it:

- Directly affects paid features
- Blocks a workflow that customers pay for
- Mentioned in an SLA or contract
- Support tickets piling up (costs money to handle)
- Violates compliance requirements (costs money to fix later)

### Real examples:

- "Premium users can't access premium features" (High: we're literally not delivering what they paid for)
- "Free tier users see a loading spinner for 0.5 seconds longer" (Low: nobody's paying for speed on free tier)
- "Data export feature returns corrupted files" (High: customers depend on this for their business)

## Medium (AKA "We'll Fix It Eventually")

**Official definition:** Moderate functionality issues; workarounds exist.

**What it actually means:** It's annoying, but nobody's yelling about it yet.

This is where most bugs live and die. Medium is the purgatory of bug priorities. It's important enough to log but not important enough to interrupt anyone's sprint.

If there's a workaround, even a terrible one, it's probably Medium. "Just refresh the page three times" counts as a workaround.

### How to spot it:

- Affects a feature people use but don't rely on
- Has a workaround (even if it's annoying)
- Only happens in specific edge cases
- Been in the backlog for 4+ months
- Gets discussed in every planning meeting but never makes the cut

### Real examples:

- "Search doesn't work with special characters" (Medium: just don't use special characters, duh)
- "Mobile app crashes when you rotate the screen 6 times quickly" (Medium: who does that?)
- "Notification settings reset after logout" (Medium: you can just re-set them, right?)

## Low (AKA "Nice to Have a Record of This")

**Official definition:** Minor cosmetic issues, no functional impact.

**What it actually means:** We're logging this so you stop bringing it up.

Low-priority bugs are filed for documentation purposes. They might get fixed if a developer is bored, or if they're touching that code anyway for something else, or never.

If it's visual, inconsistent, or "technically wrong but nobody cares," it's Low.

### How to spot it:

- Starts with "It would be nice if..."
- Cosmetic or visual inconsistencies
- Affects 0.1% of users in a weird scenario
- Works, but not the way you expected
- Has been "Low" for 3+ years

### Real examples:

- "Button text is #333333 instead of #000000" (Low: can you even tell?)
- "Error message has a typo: 'occured' instead of 'occurred'" (Low: you understood it, right?)
- "Tooltip appears 2 pixels to the left of where it should" (Low: why are you measuring tooltip positions? Stop please, we have designers to obsess over this! :) )

## The Hidden Categories Nobody Talks About

### "Executive Critical" (AKA "The CEO Saw It")

This isn't a real severity level, but you'll see it constantly.

**What it means:** Someone important noticed something, and now it's treated like the world is ending, even though technically it's Low or Medium.

The misaligned logo becomes "Critical" because the CEO mentioned it. The typo in the marketing email became "drop everything" because an investor saw it.

This is a political priority, not a technical severity. And yes, you still have to fix it immediately.

**How to handle it:**

- Log it with proper documentation (arguing won't help)
- Note the actual severity in the ticket comments
- Use it as an example later when advocating for actual critical bugs
- Remember: perception is reality in business

**Real examples:**

- "Logo is 3 pixels off-center" (Low severity, Executive Critical priority: CEO noticed during investor demo)
- "Typo on homepage: 'their' instead of 'there'" (Low severity, Executive Critical priority: board member pointed it out)
- "Button color doesn't match brand guidelines" (Low severity, Executive Critical priority: CMO is particular about brand)

### "Won't Fix" (AKA "It's a Feature Now")

This isn't technically a severity level, but it's a hole where a lot of bugs end up.

**What it means:** We've decided this behavior is acceptable, even if it's weird.

Sometimes it's because the fix would break something else. Sometimes it's because users have adapted to it. Sometimes it's because the PM just doesn't want to deal with it.

**Real examples:**

- "Date picker defaults to 1/1/1970 on first load" (Won't Fix: users just click the date they want)
- "Password field doesn't show strength indicator" (Won't Fix: rebuilding the auth flow isn't worth it)
- "System allows passwords with spaces" (Won't Fix: technically valid, and changing it would break existing users)

But remember, you MUST document this stuff just in case…

### "Cannot Reproduce" (AKA "It Works on My Machine")

The most frustrating category. The bug exists, you've seen it, but nobody else can "make it happen".

**What it means:** Either your reproduction steps are incomplete, or there's some environmental factor you haven't figured out, ooooor, just orrrrrr there are some situations when a dev is really not in the mood to deal with your "ideas"

**How to avoid it:**

- Better reproduction steps (be obsessive about details)
- Screen recordings
- Logs, network traces, anything that proves it happened
- Test on the exact same setup that the user reported from

### "By Design" (AKA "We Built It Wrong on Purpose")

The system is doing exactly what it was designed to do. The design is just terrible.

**What it means:** This isn't a bug, it's a feature request. Good luck getting anyone to prioritize that.

**Real examples:**

- "Why does logout require two clicks?" (By Design: prevents accidental logouts)
- "Why can't I delete my account?" (By Design: retention strategy)
- "Why does this form have 47 required fields?" (By Design: someone in legal demanded it)

And my favourite is a cashier's application that logs out after a sale is complete, as 2 cashiers were working on one computer and kept interrupting each other's work, so "logged in" someone else is working, stay away and wait your turn. I kid you not, there is a piece of software out there with this feature…

## The Politics of Bug Severity

Here's the uncomfortable truth: bug severity can get political…

The same bug can be Critical on Monday and Low on Friday, depending on:

- Who reported it
- What else is on fire
- How close are we to a deadline
- Whether the PM is in a good mood
- If the fix is easy or hard

I've seen developers argue a critical payment bug down to Medium because "it's complicated and we have a release tomorrow."

I've seen PMs escalate a cosmetic issue to Critical because "the client demo is in an hour and this looks unprofessional."

Your job as a QA engineer isn't just to find bugs. It's to advocate for the right severity level based on actual impact.

## How to Fight for the Right Severity

### When escalating UP:

**Connect it to business impact:**

- "This affects 40% of our user base" (data)
- "We're in breach of our SLA with Customer X" (legal)
- "Support is getting 50 tickets/day about this" (cost)
- "This violates GDPR requirements" (compliance)

**Show evidence:**

- User reports
- Analytics data
- Screen recordings
- Financial impact calculations

### When arguing DOWN:

**Provide context:**

- "Only happens in Safari 12, which is 0.02% of our traffic."
- "There's a workaround: users can just click 'retry'"
- "This component is being replaced next sprint anyway."
- "We shipped this behavior 2 years ago, and nobody's complaining."

**Offer alternatives:**

- "Can we document the workaround while we plan a proper solution?"
- "What if we hide this feature temporarily?"
- "Should we just remove this rather than address it?"

## Red Flags That Severity Is Wrong

### When "Critical" might actually be Medium:

- Only happens in one specific scenario
- Affects internal tools, not customer-facing features
- Has existed for months without anyone noticing
- Resolution requires major architectural changes

### When "Low" might actually be High:

- Happens frequently but in different ways (pattern not recognized)
- Affects new users more than existing ones (they don't know the workarounds)
- Slowly degrading over time (performance, data quality)
- Causes workaround behaviors that introduce other risks

## The Real Severity Matrix

Here's what actually determines priority:

- **Critical** = Visible + Important Person Noticed
- **High** = Money + Measurable Impact
- **Medium** = Annoying + Has Workaround
- **Low** = Technically Wrong + Nobody Cares

And the secret level: **Ignored** = True Impact Unknown

## What This Means for You

Stop treating severity as an objective technical truth. It's a negotiation tool.

**As a junior tester:** Learn to speak the language of business impact. "The button is broken" gets ignored. "40% of mobile users can't complete checkout" gets attention.

**As a senior tester:** Pick your battles. Not every bug deserves a fight. Save your credibility for the bugs that actually matter.

**As a test lead:** Teach your team that severity isn't about the bug, it's about the impact. And impact is measured in money, users, and reputation.

The companies that get this right are the ones where:

- Testers understand business priorities
- Developers trust tester's judgment on severity
- Product managers actually look at the data
- Everyone agrees on what "critical" really means

The companies that get it wrong spend all their time fighting about priority levels instead of addressing bugs.

## One Last Thing

I've logged bugs marked Critical that still aren't resolved years later, and I don't even work there anymore :) .

I've logged bugs marked Low that got hotfixed within an hour.

Severity levels are guidelines, not gospel. Your job is to provide the information that helps the team make good decisions.

Find the bugs. Document the impact. Argue for the right priority. Then let the team decide.

And when a bug marked "Low" blows up in production six months later? Well, you've got receipts.
